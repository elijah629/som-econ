The SoMconomy is booming! By how much you ask? `som-econ` has the answer!

`som-econ` includes comprehensive graphs for the SoM economy including: Net
Worth and Transactions over time, Lorenz curve, Gini Number, transaction types,
and an estimated count of bought shop items. It includes all of that AND every
price in USD through a custom USD-shells estimator.

~~You need a `.env` file with a `SLACK_BOT` var set to `xoxb-******` for a slack

The above has been handled by the parth API!
